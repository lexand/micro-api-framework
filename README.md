# micro-api-framework
API (or single page application) oriented micro framework

## GOAL
The main goal of this micro framework is in the easiest way to transfer DTO (data transfer objects) via JSON through
HTTP POST method to application and response DTO to client.
  
DTO idea was selected to solve validation problem of input data and simplification in documenting API methods.  

## TODO
1. Add support of encrypted cookies
2. Possibly add PSR-7 support
3. Add reflection cashing
4. Add example for access filters
