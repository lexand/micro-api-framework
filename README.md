# micro-api-framework
API (or single page application) oriented micro framework

## GOAL
The main goal of this micro-framework is in the easiest way to transfer DTO (data transfer objects) via JSON (but can be
changed via \microapi\dto\DtoFactory) through HTTP methods to application and response DTO to client.
  
DTO idea was selected to solve validation problem of input data and simplification in documenting API methods.  

## TODO
1. Possibly add PSR-7 support
2. Add example for access filters
